# Running the React Application

- Start the Frontend development server: 
                                npm start

-The frontend will be accessible at -  http://localhost:3000.

- Running the Backend
To start the backend development server, run the following command:
    -> Go to terminal -> 
                        >D:\mernproject>cd src   

                        >D:\mernproject\src>cd UiForm  

                        >D:\mernproject\src\UiForm>cd server

                        >D:\mernproject\src\UiForm\server>node UserData.js   .... Server ll be started, after you can fetch the data.

                        (or)
- Running the Backend
To start the backend development server, navigate to the server directory and run the following command:
                        >cd src/UiForm/server
                        >node UserData.js

    (or) 

Alternatively, you can open the terminal directly in the server directory and run the command:
(-> you can open Terminal and file directly by right click on file and then click on :->open in Integrated Terminal )
                      
                      :\mernproject\src\UiForm\server>node UserData.js

This will start the backend server, allowing you to fetch data from the MongoDB database.
